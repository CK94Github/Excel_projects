Dashboards_using excel
created a sales dashboard in Excel that can help analyse the store’s sales performance. Also, it could help improve work management across the different selling platforms.-
As per data source, we have only the basic order information. This should be available for any online store and most stores have a sales/order workbook in hand.
There are two target audiences:
Investors – You are growing the business. There is no better way to showcase your store’s potential than with a well-designed dashboard in Excel.
To win over investors, we have presented sales figures and other key metrics.
Management (yourself and/or your team) – Excel dashboards are also a great way to visualize workload. You can study your team’s performance in terms of how many orders are being processed each week and how quickly the store delivers its products.
